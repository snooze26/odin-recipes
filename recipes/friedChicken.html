        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul class="ingredients">
            <strong id="ingredientsHeader">List of Ingredients</strong>
                <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
                <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <ol class="steps">
            <strong id="stepsHeader">Steps</strong>
                <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer</li>
                <li>Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). 
                    Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken)</li>
                <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well</li>
                <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. 
                    LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL</li>
                <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot</li>
                <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides</li>
        </ol>
